About the Project:

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the World Happiness Report 2023 dataset. The goal is to understand the factors that contribute to happiness across different countries and visualize the relationships between these factors.

Insights and Summary:

. The 'happiness_score' has a strong positive correlation with 'logged_gdp_per_capita', 'social_support', and 'healthy_life_expectancy'. This suggests that countries with higher GDP, better social support systems, and longer life expectancies tend to have higher happiness scores.

. 'freedom_to_make_life_choices' and 'perceptions_of_corruption' also show a moderate positive and negative correlation with the happiness score, respectively.

. 'generosity' has a very weak positive correlation with the happiness score.

. The project successfully cleans, analyzes, and visualizes the World Happiness Report 2023 dataset, providing valuable insights into the factors that influence happiness across the globe.
